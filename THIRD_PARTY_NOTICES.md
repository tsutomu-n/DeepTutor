- Source commit: `4e0af6ba7909dca22f1257b168172ecbe4af4836`
- License: MIT
- Copyright: Copyright (c) 2026 shanjunjie
- Adapted concepts: PKCE loopback login, auth generations, atomic credential updates, model-catalog cache invalidation, and redacted operation states.

implements them independently against DeepTutor's own settings directory, model
catalog, and provider lifecycle. The MIT license text from that source commit
